Procedure for running idealized baroclinic-wave simulations in WRF
Methodology from Lloveras and Durran (2023)

Step 1 - Download and compile the numerical model:
WRF version 3.6.1: https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/download/get_sources.html

Step 2 - Zonally uniform jet:
Run "make_jet.py" with parameter options at beginning of script
Creates netCDF file "wrfin_start" containing input fields for WRF

Step 3 - Run zonally uniform jet through WRF:
Copy "wrfin_start" (rename to "wrfinput_d01") into WRF directory
Run WRF (wrf.exe) for 36 hours
Use "namelist.input_init" when running (rename to "namelist.input")
Creates netCDF file (rename to "wrfout_osc")

Step 4 - Average over oscillations:
Copy "wrfin_start" into new file "wrfin_avg"
Run "avg_oscillations.py"
Script averages fields in "wrfout_osc" and places new fields into "wrfin_avg"
Repeat steps 3+4 as many times as desired to obtain steady jet

Step 5 - Add cyclogenetic perturbations and/or moisture:
Copy "wrfin_avg" into new file "wrfin"
Run "add_qgpv_moist.py" with parameter options at beginning of script
Script computes new fields and places them into "wrfin"

Step 6 - Run WRF:
Copy "wrfin"(rename to "wrfinput_d01") into WRF directory
Run WRF (wrf.exe) for desired length
Use "namelist.input_dry_20km" for dry runs
Use "namelist.input_moist_20km" for moist runs with parameterized convection
Use "namelist.input_moist_4km" for moist runs with explicit convection
Rename namelist file to "namelist.input"
Creates netCDF file (rename to "wrfout")

Optional: To obtain initial conditions for runs with finer grid spacing, run "interp_20_to_4km.py"
